# Ebay Parser
### A python script that parses Ebay for baseball bats

For this project for CS40, I created a python script that searches for the term 'baseball bat' on Ebay, and returns the title, price, and wear of the item being sold.

### Things to know about the script:
* The script can be edited in that you can replace the search term for whatever you want and it'll return the same results for whatever search term you choose.
* It uses thee bs4, requests, and json library
* When running on python, it won't return anything but the Length of the Results and the Status Code (for the results library); the info will all be in the json library

### Why I chose the term 'baseball bat'
I chose 'baseball bat' as my term because I'm a huge baseball fanatic and play baseball in college. I also love hitting, hence the additional term 'bat'
